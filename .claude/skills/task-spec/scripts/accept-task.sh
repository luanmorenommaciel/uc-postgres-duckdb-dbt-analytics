# accept-task.sh — POST-execution acceptance gate for a Task-Spec (C7).
#
# Position in the lifecycle:
#   AUTHOR → safe-to-delegate.sh (PRE-gate) → DISPATCH → EXECUTE → accept-task.sh (POST-gate)
#
# safe-to-delegate asks "are this spec's evals well-formed enough to delegate?"
# (assertion failure is EXPECTED — the work is not built yet). accept-task asks
# the OPPOSITE question: "now that an executor claims it is done, is the work
# REAL?" — and it answers WITHOUT trusting the executor's word, by checking three
# independent trust gaps:
#
#   GATE A — evals PASS (re-run by us). The Exit Check must return 0. This is the
#            inversion of safe-to-delegate: there, a pass on unbuilt work is a
#            smell; here, a pass is the whole point.
#   GATE B — blast-radius compliance. Every changed file must be inside
#            touches_paths/creates_paths and NONE in do-not-touch. Defends against
#            an agent that satisfied the eval by editing things it should not have
#            (the Goodhart guard). Skipped with --no-blast-radius for ad-hoc use.
#   GATE C — contract integrity. The sign-off HMAC envelope must still verify, i.e.
#            the eval bodies / behavior were NOT edited after the gate stamped them.
#            Defends against an agent that made evals pass by weakening them.
#            Degrades to a warning (not a block) when no key/crypto is present,
#            mirroring the Tier-2 degrade of the sign-off envelope.
#
# On success it stamps the acceptance envelope into the frontmatter:
#   accepted: true, accepted_by: <user>, accepted_at: <iso-8601>
# A spec is DONE — provably, not by assertion — only when accept-task returns
# VERDICT: ACCEPT and writes that envelope.
#
# Two OPT-IN B3 gates harden against 2026-era reward-hacking (a "clean re-run" is
# not enough — e.g. an eval that passes by retrieval or that is simply always-true):
#
#   GATE D — isolation report (requires:). If the spec declares a `requires:` block
#            (base_image / deps / network), REPORT what isolation the executor's
#            sandbox must have provided. The bash tool cannot enforce egress, so
#            this is DOCUMENT-AND-WARN, never a blocker — EXCEPT it WARNS (still not
#            a block) when a `full`-profile spec leaves requires.network UNSET, since
#            an unattended full task with undeclared egress is the reward-hacking
#            attack surface. Absent `requires:` on a non-full profile → silent.
#   GATE E — gold-sanity (--gold-sanity, opt-in). The Goodhart-guard upgrade: an eval
#            that PASSES on the UNPATCHED baseline is non-discriminating (always-true /
#            reward-hackable) and is BLOCKED. It reconstructs the baseline in an
#            ephemeral git worktree at the baseline ref (--base, or a frontmatter
#            baseline_ref:/reference_solution:), runs the CURRENT spec's evals there
#            (must FAIL), and runs them on the current state (must PASS). Degrades to
#            a WARN (never a hard-fail) when git or the baseline ref is unavailable.
#
# Usage:
#   bash accept-task.sh [--stamp] [--no-blast-radius] [--gold-sanity] \
#                       [--accepted-by NAME] [--base REF] <path/to/T-*.md>
#
# Flags:
#   --stamp            write the accepted envelope on success (default: dry-run report only)
#   --no-blast-radius  skip GATE B (changed-files-vs-touches_paths). Use when the
#                      change set is intentionally broad or git is unavailable.
#   --gold-sanity      enable GATE E (gold-sanity). OFF by default so existing
#                      callers are unchanged. BLOCKS any eval that passes on the
#                      unpatched baseline (non-discriminating / reward-hackable).
#   --accepted-by NAME override the accepted_by value (default: $USER)
#   --base REF         git ref to diff the change set against for GATE B, and the
#                      baseline ref for GATE E gold-sanity (default: HEAD).
#                      A frontmatter baseline_ref:/reference_solution: overrides the
#                      default for GATE E only.
#
# Machine-readable contract:
#   On ACCEPT, emits exactly one line `ACCEPTED=1` to stdout (dispatchers parse it).
#   On REJECT, emits `ACCEPTED=0` and exits 1.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — ACCEPT: the work is real (evals pass + blast-radius clean + envelope intact)
#   1 — REJECT: a gate failed; the spec is NOT accepted
#   2 — usage / file error
